# AgrifieldNet India 

The repo contains data prep, eda and modeling code for the [AgrifieldNet India Challenge](https://zindi.africa/competitions/agrifieldnet-india-challenge). 

## Prerequisites

- Pipenv

## Running the things

From within this directory run the following

- `pipenv shell`
- `pipenv install`

After that, you are ready to head to the `code/notebooks` directory and explore. 

*Note 1: I ran these notebooks inside VSCode, however, one could just as easily execute `jupyter` from the commandline and use the web interface.*

*Note 2: Geospatial processing will require `gdal` which is not currently included in the `Pipfile` due to compatibility issues with other packages.*
